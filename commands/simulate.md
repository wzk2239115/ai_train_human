# /simulate

Practice high-stakes situations with AI as your sparring partner.

## Usage

```
/simulate <scenario> [context]
```

**Scenarios:**
- `interview` - Job interview (technical, behavioral, case study)
- `negotiation` - Salary, contract, business deal
- `presentation` - Pitch, demo, keynote
- `debate` - Argue a position you believe (or don't)
- `difficult-conversation` - Feedback, conflict resolution
- `sales-call` - Cold outreach, discovery, closing

**Context examples:**
- `/simulate interview senior frontend engineer`
- `/simulate negotiation salary increase`
- `/simulate presentation investor pitch pre-seed startup`
- `/simulate difficult-conversation giving feedback to underperformer`

## What This Command Does

1. **Set the stage** - Define roles, stakes, context
2. **Start the simulation** - AI plays the counterpart
3. **Realistic resistance** - AI pushes back appropriately
4. **Debrief** - After simulation, AI analyzes performance

## Simulation Structure

```
## Setup
[Scenario context, your role, my role, stakes]

## Simulation Begins
[Interactive back-and-forth]

## Debrief
[What worked, what didn't, specific improvements]
```

## Pro Tips

- **Stay in character** - Treat it like the real thing
- **Be specific** - More context = better simulation
- **Fail here** - Better to mess up with AI than in real life
- **Repeat** - Run the same scenario multiple times

## Philosophy

> "Amateurs practice until they get it right. Professionals practice until they can't get it wrong."

Low-stakes practice → high-stakes performance.
